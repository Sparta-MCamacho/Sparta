**Overview**
---
SortManager is a program designed to be able to test your implementations 
                                                                           of any sort algorithm which can sort a primitive `int[]` array from Java. 
                                                                           The SortManager used here comes with 7 implementations of different sorting 
algorithms, and an explanation of adding your own is shown below.
